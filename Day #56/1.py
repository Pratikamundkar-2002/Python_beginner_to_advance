
# Introduction to (OOPS) OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

'''
there a re two types of progamming :-
Procedural Programming- ji atta parynt karat alo, creating functions applying logic

Object Oriented Programming- 
# It uses Class and Objects to represent real-world concepts and entities
# Class is a blueprint OR template for creating Objects, it shows the properties 
  that a object of Class will have
# Methods are actions that a object perform

Encapsulation in oops-
internal state of object is hidden and can be only accessed/modified through object methods
It helps to protect objects data and prevent it from being modified

Inheritence-
allows new class to be created that inherit hr properties/methods of existing class

Polymorphism-
objects of diff classes can be treated as if they are object of common class

Summary:-
OOPS in python allows developers to model real-world concepts and entities thru class
and objects, encapsulate data, code reuse thru inheritence, and write more flexible code 
through polymorphism
